# The following types define the data model of the example service
# based on which the GraphQL API is generated

type User @model {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  name: String
  dateOfBirth: DateTime

  # Uncomment below - you can declare relations between models like this

  #posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "UserPosts")
}


type Post @model {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  description: String!
  imageUrl: String!

  # Every relation also required a back-relation (to determine 1:1, 1:n or n:m)
  #
  # commenting out for now since I don't know 
  # how to put this into code
  # author: User! @relation(name: "UserPosts")
}
